# Mass Record Locking
An external module for mass locking records. Is compatible with both classic and longitudinal projects, and only accessible by superusers and users with design rights on the project.

## Limitations
1. Incompatible with repeatable events/instruments. Only locks the first instance of a repeatable instrument.
